        <p>I have been thinking hard about the purpose of this site. Starting something is always the hardest part of any journey. This project was initially a challenge to myself as I took on a new position at my company, transitioning from a software engineer developing a custom CI/CD solution to the infrastructure engineering team managing the company&rsquo;s cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes clusters, and everything in between. This was my way to show that I can stand up a cloud-native stack utilizing the tools of the trade. Coming from a more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; software engineering team focused on building a single product, I had a chance to leverage my existing skill set by setting up a project in GitHub, spinning up tickets, and getting to work. You can follow along with this project on <a href="https://github.com/MattPerreault/cloud_profile"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Once I had a successful page up and running, I looked back at the project and made sure I delivered everything I sought out to deliver. A project with a roadmap utilizing a version control system, check. All of my infrastructure hosted in the cloud, check. Everything managed with Terraform, check. Not bad, but now what? This is the never-ending question all engineers eventually run into. How can I make my project more streamlined? Automate all the things! Get a decent CI/CD pipeline set up. Make sure everything is tested. Keep adding some nice-to-have features to make the SDLC smoother. These are all things on my roadmap, no doubt. However, as I sat there pulling up this page on my computer, then on my phone to make sure everything looked reasonably clean, I thought to myself this could be more than just a place for me to host my resume.</p>
<p>If you know anything about me, you know I am an avid reader. I devour books, mostly fantasy these days, but if it has a compelling story with morally gray characters, I&rsquo;m all in. Recently, I have started dabbling in philosophy, most notably Stoic philosophers. Right now, it&rsquo;s a lot of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca. The Stoics talk a lot about following your nature, honing your disciplines, and living with virtue. One way to hold yourself accountable is to write about your experiences. After reading Seneca&rsquo;s &ldquo;On the Shortness of Life,&rdquo; it came to me. This blog will be my outlet. I have decided to write about my personal and professional growth. I am thinking of it as my cloud journal. The theme that I am going to focus on is &ldquo;know your systems.&rdquo; As an engineer, I am constantly striving to understand how things work fundamentally. This will be a space where I can explore those ideas. I will first talk about the systems and tools that were used to build this cloud stack. I will be sure to focus on the things that I struggled with and how I overcame those obstacles. Then I will talk about other systems, not just software-based ones, such as working in a team, the mind, etc. I will discuss the tools and processes I implement in my day-to-day as I try to navigate through life.</p>
<p>I am not doing this for views or ad revenue. This will be my space to think deeply about the world in my personal and professional life. I hope to be able to look back on this project and see what systems I have gotten to work with, what tools I have learned to wield, and most importantly, how I have held myself accountable to the ideas I think are worth living out. If you happen to stumble upon this site and want to talk about anything I discuss, please feel free to reach out to me! I can be found mostly on GitHub and LinkedIn nowadays. I&rsquo;m not on social media, which may be something to write about in the future. I welcome you to Know Your Systems!</p>
