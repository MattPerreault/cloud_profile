      <description>I am a Denver based software engineer who enjoys working on and improving distributed systems. I have worked all over the stack, from full-stack product development to standing up a cloud native data management and processing system. I have had the pleassure to work with cutting edge cloud tools like AWS Redshift, Kinesis, Glue and more! I have been on green field projects, most recently implementing a cloud-native CI/CD solution powered by Argo.</description>
